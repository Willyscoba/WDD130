                <p>Most people know how much fun White water rafting can be, but, truth be told, thatâ€™s not the only great thing about it.
                    There are actually studies on river rafting, and on activities in the outdoors, which show that not only are these
                    things fun, there are thousands of health benefits as well. Today, we want to share with you, what we offers, which is
                    those health benefits. Enjoy!</p>

                <p>The thrill of adventure! (a.k.a adrenaline rush):
                    we have to start with the most obvious health benefit. Which is providing you with an adrenaline rush.
                    Going through each turn of the river and battling through every rapid boosts your adrenaline. 
                    And this is needed to enjoy a more healthy, long life. Which is why, the thrill of the adventure, 
                    or adrenaline rush, is the first health benefit on our list.</p>
                <p>The Outdoors & Fresh Air = Reduced Stress: When people are getting tired of their jobs or just tired in general, 
                    one way they can reduce their stress is by going outdoors. Now, studies show that being outdoors in fresh air, 
                    and not cooped up in your office, is far more beneficial to your mental health and stress levels than any indoor activities. 
                    Even the silence that nature brings is relaxing and helps you to alleviate your stress.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, no matter how you look at it, getting out of the office, out of the house, 
                    and out into nature is one of the best ways to increase your health. But, of course, as bias as we are about it,
                    we believe that riding the rapids of the Rio Grande is the best way to add years to your life. Come join us this season!.</p>
